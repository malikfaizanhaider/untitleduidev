		<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
		<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
		</p>
		<p>You agree that any dispute between you and Aeldra arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services (collectively, "Disputes") will be governed by the arbitration procedure outlined below.</p>
		<p><u>Governing Law</u>. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Agreement and the resolution of any Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles. These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live, but if you live outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of the mandatory consumer protection provisions of your local consumer protection law</p>
		<p><u>Informal Dispute Resolution</u>. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Aeldra, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting support@aeldra.com. We will try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you through email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission, you or Aeldra may bring a formal proceeding.</p>
		<p><u>We Both Agree To Arbitrate</u>. You and Aeldra agree to resolve any Disputes through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.</p>
		<p><u>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate</u>. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting [insert email] within 30 days of first accepting this Agreement and stating that you (include your first and last name) decline this arbitration agreement.</p>
		<p><u>Arbitration Procedures</u>. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect. Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco, California, or any other location we agree to.</p>
		<p><u>Arbitration Fees</u>. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. If the value of your claim does not exceed $10,000, Aeldra will pay for the reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.
		</p>
		<p><u>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</u>. Either you or Aeldra may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco, California, or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.</p>
		<p><u>No Class Actions</u>. You may only resolve Disputes with Aeldra on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed under our agreement.</p>
		<p><u>Judicial Forum for Disputes</u>. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Aeldra agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California. Both you and Aeldra consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.
		</p>
		<p><u>Limitation on Claims</u>. Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.</p>
